Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/cdu8/m6A_sldsc_torus_Xiao/tree/2a6a00a283675838b68aefbd90b5c63f21bba8b7" target="_blank">2a6a00a</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/sldsc_torus.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/sldsc_torus.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>I ran S-LDSC and Torus on m6A annotations of 8 tissues: brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, placenta, and stomach. I did this for 11 GWAS: Asthma, BMI, CAD, HDL, Height, Intelligence, IBD, LDL, RA, Schizophrenia, and Type II Diabetes. I also ran Torus for blood pressure GWAS: diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (DBP), and systolic blood pressure (SBP).</p>
<p>m6A annotations used are from this paper: Xiao et al. The RNA N6-methyladenosine modification landscape of human fetal tissues. Nature 2019.</p>
</div>
<div id="s-ldsc" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>S-LDSC</strong></h2>
<p>For S-LDSC, I used two baseline models:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A subset of the baseline LD annotations located here: <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/kevinluo/ldsc/annot/ldscores/baseline_gene_MAF_LD/</code></li>
<li>Baseline LD v1.1 located here: <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/kevinluo/ldsc/LDSCORE/1000G_Phase3_baselineLD_v1.1_ldscores</code></li>
</ol>
<div id="gwas-and-m6a-annotations" class="section level3">
<h3>GWAS and m6A annotations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>GWAS summary statistics in the sumstats format (excluding Intelligence) are located at <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/kevinluo/GWAS/GWAS_summary_stats/GWAS_collection/ldsc_format</code></li>
<li>Intelligence GWAS in the sumstats format is located at <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/kevinluo/GWAS/GWAS_summary_stats/GWAS_from_Min/ldsc_format</code></li>
<li>The original m6A annotations in BED format are located at <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/cdu/ldsc/results/sLDSC_Xiao_m6A_2019/Annot/hg38/Bed</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Because the GWAS summary statistics were based on the hg19 map, the m6A annotations were converted from hg38 to hg19 using <code>liftOver</code>.</p>

<li>Asthma, BMI, HDL, Height, LDL, RA, and Schizophrenia GWAS are located at <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/kevinluo/GWAS/GWAS_summary_stats/GWAS_collection/GWAS_raw</code></li>
<li>The Intelligence GWAS is located at <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/kevinluo/GWAS/GWAS_summary_stats/GWAS_from_Min/raw_data</code></li>

<li>The liftOver hg19 m6A annotations are located at <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/cdu/torus/annot/Xiao/hg19</code></li>
<li>GWAS data suitable for Torus can be found here <code>RCC:/project2/xinhe/cdu/GWAS/Xiao_torus_format</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two BMI GWAS datasets: <code>BMI_GWAS_fromScott.txt.gz</code> and <code>BMI_GWAS_raw</code>. The <code>BMI_GWAS_raw</code> dataset was missing the chromosome and position data, so the missing SNP positions were taken from <code>BMI_GWAS_fromScott.txt.gz</code>. Of the 2554637 SNPs reported in <code>BMI_GWAS_raw</code>, 2092511 matched those in <code>BMI_GWAS_fromScott.txt.gz</code>.</p>
<p>Running Torus on T2D GWAS failed because too few T2D variants were matched - only 10,428 out of 2,470,851 variants were matched.</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
